bridge-utils (1.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Linux kernel has changed bridge MAC address selection.

  In older Linux kernels the MAC of the bridge was the lower mac of the
  devices attached to it, this is no longer the case now at Bullseye. The
  kernel now makes up a completely new MAC address.

  This means that if you rely on your bridge's MAC address for something
  like DHCP leases or similar stuff you'll loose this feature. The only way
  to go back to your old MAC address is to assign it to the bridge
  explicitly using bridge_hw followed by the wanted MAC address on your
  bridge definition.
  
  To help with the problem caused by the kernel change of address selection
  (see below for more info on this) we have overloaded bridge_hw option so
  that you can specify the address you want or the name of an interface to
  take the MAC address from it.

  In the past setting the bridge hardware address was not considered safe,
  this is no longer a problem, currently it is necessary or recommended in a
  lot of scenarios like IPv6, DHCP reservations, ... the ussage of bridge_hw
  setting if the recommended way of doing this.

  Support for more than one stanza for one interface is now supported, see
  README and examples.

bridge-utils (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Hotplug disabled by default.

  In stretch we shipped with hotplug enabled and this resulted on several
  problems that we hadn't spotted before that. We are now going back to
  what has been the normal behaviour, which is hotplug disabled, this is
  the behaviour that makes more sense thinking on servers (they usually
  don't need hotplug) and given that a bridge is something you would
  typically only use on servers, I think this is what will give us less
  problems.

  Of course if you were using hotplug you can still enable it setting
  BRIDGE_HOTPLUG=yes at /etc/default/bridge-utils.

bridge-utils (1.5-11) unstable; urgency=low

  Hotplug enabled by default, integration with vlan removed.

  At package version 1.5-3 we introduced hotplug code in the code to add
  ports to the bridge as they are plugged on the system, however, at version
  1.5-4 to avoid problems with old setups we had BRIDGE_HOTPLUG=no at
  /etc/default/bridge-utils to disable the new code (see this
  bugs.debian.org/673490 for more info).

  Beginning with this release, and given the problems detected since the
  introduction of systemd, the BRIDGE_HOTPLUG default will be yes in order
  to enable the hotplug code and avoid the problems with systemd or other
  hotplug scenarios.

  If you still want the behaviour with hotplug disabled you just have to
  change BRIDGE_HOTPLUG to no at /etc/default/bridge-utils and you're done.

  On this version we've also removed integration with the vlan package,
  we're leaving vlan setup to the ifupdown package.
